Hi, I'm Jared Rodriguez. I'm a Computer Science graduate interested in using technology to help better people's lives and solve problems we all face.
My favorite languages are C++, Python, Java and Kotlin, but I love learning new ones and exploring their differences. I love to come up with creative solutions
and work together with teams to create and innovate.
